# Mastermind

To run:

Thought process:

I used MERN stack to develop this project. First part was setting up the structure:
- Setting up the Application
- Setting up the Node Server
- Creating the Routes
- Defining the Models
- Deciding on the database
- Connecting to the database
- Testing the API
- Creating the Frontend
- Running the React App
- Creating the React Components
- Writing tests
- Deploying to AWS
- Circle CI and SonarCloud
- Testing with K6
- Scaling with a load balancer
- Retesting with LoaderIo
- Ensuring 90% Google Data
- Working on Advanced Content

Please make sure your project contains a README.md. This README should explain how an
interviewer could run your code, document your thought process and/or code structure, and
describe any creative extensions attempted or implemented. There is no prescribed format for
the README, but it should be clear and unambiguous in listing all the steps in building, running,
and playing the game you built (you should make no assumptions about what software the
interviewer has, and err on the side of being explicit). Your interviewers will be engineers, so
you can assume a certain level of technical ability as relates to installing what your project
requires.

If submitting through a public repository is not an option for you, please reach out to your
recruiter for an alternative solution.
